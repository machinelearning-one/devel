## What's included in this repo?

- An _example .env_ file to parametrize the build process
- A modular and easily customizable _Dockerfile_ that defines the installation of above mentioned packages
- A _docker-compose.yml_ file to handle lifecycle events such as building the image, spinning up the container and tearing it down.

## Prerequisites

Download and install:

- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) 
- [Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/machinelearning-one/devel.git
```

2. Open directory in VS Code and accept installing recommended extensions if prompted:
   
```sh
cd devel
code .
```

3. Set up environment variables and rename the example file:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```
4. Create a shared directory to be mapped into the container:

```sh
export SHARED_DIR=<SHARED_DIR>
mkdir -p $SHARED_DIR
```

5. Enable Buildkit for faster and cacheable builds:
```sh
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
```

6. Set the password and start the build:

```sh
docker compose build --build-arg PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
```

7. Instantiate the container:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

8. Start developing!

> _Navigate to Remote Explorer tab on the sidebar and click on attach to the container to have a holistic development experience._


## Cleanup

To remove the container, run the following command from the same folder:

```sh
docker compose down
```
