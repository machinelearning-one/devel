## Prerequisites

Download and install:

- [Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) 
- [Docker Compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/machinelearning-one/devel.git
cd devel
```

Set up environment variables and rename the example file:

```sh
mv .env.example .env
```

Build and save the image:

```sh
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
docker compose build --build-arg PASSWORD={PASSWORD}
```

Create a shared directory and instantiate the container:

```sh
export SHARED_DIR={SHARED_DIR}
mkdir -p $SHARED_DIR
docker compose up -d
```
Use VS Code's remote containers extension to connect to the container to have a holistic development experience.


## Cleanup

To remove the container, run the following command from the same folder:

```sh
docker compose down
```
